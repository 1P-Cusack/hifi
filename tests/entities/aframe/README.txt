altspacevr files with Web suffix are the original files downloaded from: 
    https://altspacevr.github.io/aframe/examples/

These files need some minor sanitization with an xml/html tidy 
type of tool to load completely.  The tidied versions of the files 
are those sans Web suffix.  Both versions of the files are provided
to allow for diffs in the event that that's desired along with observing
the behavior of loading the raw source files.
